Installation
============

forutils is available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_, so installation into your python virtual environment is dead
simple:

.. code-block:: py

    pip install forutils

Don't have a virtual environment with pip? You probably should! ``pyenv`` is your friend. Google it.


.. _compilation:
